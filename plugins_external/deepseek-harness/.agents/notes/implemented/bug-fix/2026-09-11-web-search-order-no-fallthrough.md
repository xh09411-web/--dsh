# Agent Note: Ordered web search does not fall through to DeepSeek

Status: implemented

English | [中文](2026-09-11-web-search-order-no-fallthrough.zh.md)

## Problem

The shipped base sets `searchProviderOrder: [perplexity, exa, free]` so web search should use Perplexity, then Exa, then keyless Bing/DuckDuckGo, and only use DeepSeek when the user pins `searchProvider: deepseek-official`. After those two providers were unavailable, `resolveProvider()` still selected the unique remaining usable backend. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` makes `deepseek-official` search available, so a Grok or other chat turn billed DeepSeek search and failed with HTTP 402.

Chat-model credentials are not search credentials. Pi-ai/Grok has no provider in this seam, so "use the current model's key" cannot run DeepSeek search.

## Decision

When `searchProviderOrder` is set, it is an exclusive allowlist. Unusable ids are skipped. If none of those providers are usable, search throws `WEB_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` instead of auto-selecting an unlisted provider. Pinning `searchProvider` (including `deepseek-official`) stays strict.

## Alternatives considered

**Keep unique-usable fallthrough.** Rejected: the order was added to stop silent DeepSeek billing, and the unique remaining backend is usually DeepSeek because its key is already present for chat.

**Use the current chat model's API key for search.** Rejected: this seam's DeepSeek search talks to a separate Anthropic-compatible search endpoint. Grok/pi-ai has no search provider here.

## Consequences

- Default Perplexity → Exa → keyless Bing/DuckDuckGo search no longer bills DeepSeek when those keys are missing.
- Users who want DeepSeek search must pin `searchProvider: deepseek-official` in Settings or config.
- Compositions that omit `searchProviderOrder` still auto-select the unique usable provider.
